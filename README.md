DTIRF: Predicting Drug-Target Interactions Based on Improved Rotation Forest from Drug Molecular Structure and Protein Sequence
In this article, we design a new in silico approach, named DTIRF, to predict the DTI combine feature weighted Rotation Forest (FwRF) classifier with protein amino acids information. More specifically, we first use Position-Specific Score Matrix (PSSM) to numerically convert protein sequences and utilize Pseudo Position-Specific Score Matrix (PsePSSM) to extract their features. Then a unified digital descriptor is formed by combining molecular fingerprints representing drug information. Finally, the feature weighted rotation forest is applied to implement on Enzyme, Ion Channel, GPCR, and Nuclear Receptor data sets. The results of the five-fold cross-validation experiment show that the prediction accuracy of this approach reaches 91.68%, 88.11%, 84.72% and 78.33% on four benchmark data sets, respectively. To further validate the performance of the DTIRF, we compare it with other excellent methods and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. In addition, 7 of the 10 highest predictive scores in predicting novel DTIs were validated by relevant databases.
